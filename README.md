My journey on machine learning

It all started on 2016. Previously Machine Learning (ML) was a intuition on how numbers and data can help me to solve real problems. Between real problems, one I consider most important for me is mastering running techniques, that is I use numbers for running, and when I run. The first encounter was with a repository present in Github, "Machine Learning for Software Engineers", that showed me the graph of the houses prices compared to the location. It worked in the iPad and was an example of classification. More examples came, all with a fascination of something not known. The next step was the first technical approach, with the three methods of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised and by reinforcement. I came also on an intereting method that was explaining how to memorize things, with the flip card method.
Learning by heart the first concepts was something necessary, therefore I put on my flip cards the ML methods and I started repeating. It was funny, my daughter was asking me the methods all the afternoon, and at the end my daughter was learning better than me!
